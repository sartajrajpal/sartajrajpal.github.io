I'm a third-year undergraduate at Yale studying computer science and philosophy. I'm particularly interested in the ethical implications of artificial intelligence as well as natural language processing. Right now, I'm building a couple side projects with friends, like [Oliver](https://tryoliver.xyz). More to come soon...
